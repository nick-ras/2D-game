# MinilibX Project

## Description
The **MinilibX** project involves creating a simple graphics library that allows you to open a window, draw basic shapes, and handle user input in a graphical environment. The goal of the project is to understand the fundamentals of graphics programming in C and learn how to interact with the X11 window system on Unix-like systems. MinilibX simplifies drawing pixels, handling window events, and providing an interface for graphical output.

In this project, you'll implement basic graphical functions such as creating a window, drawing images, and handling keyboard or mouse inputs. This is a foundational project for understanding how graphical user interfaces (GUIs) work at a low level and how they interact with hardware and operating systems.

## Project Requirements

- **Window Management:**  
  You need to create a window on the screen where graphics can be rendered. This window should respond to events like resizing or closing.

- **Drawing Basic Graphics:**  
  The library should allow drawing basic shapes such as pixels, lines, and rectangles in the window.

- **Event Handling:**  
  Handle events like mouse clicks, mouse movements, and key presses to allow interaction with the graphical content displayed in the window.

- **Graphics Manipulation:**  
  You should provide functionality to change the color of pixels, draw images, and manage layers of graphics on the screen.

## Key Restrictions & Challenges

- **X11 and Low-Level Graphics:**  
  MinilibX requires interacting with the X11 system, which is a low-level window system on Unix-based systems. This means you need to understand how X11 works, including its event loop, window management, and graphics context. The project forces you to handle the intricacies of working with an external system and library for graphics.

- **Event Handling:**  
  Event handling in MinilibX is typically done in a loop, where the program constantly checks for user inputs like keyboard presses or mouse movements. Handling these inputs in a real-time event-driven manner can be tricky, especially if you have multiple events happening simultaneously.

- **Graphics Rendering:**  
  Rendering graphics involves using low-level functions to manipulate the display buffer. The challenge lies in understanding how to manipulate pixel data and manage graphical output efficiently.

- **Memory Management:**  
  MinilibX requires efficient memory handling to store and manage images or graphical objects. Ensuring that memory is properly allocated, freed, and that no memory leaks occur while manipulating graphics is an essential part of the project.

- **Limited Functionality:**  
  Unlike full-featured graphics libraries like OpenGL or SDL, MinilibX is designed to be minimalist. This means you need to implement many features manually, and you donâ€™t have access to advanced graphical techniques. The project pushes you to use basic methods and algorithms to handle rendering.

## Requirements for Running It

- The program can be run in **WSL2** or **macOS**.  
- If you are using **WSL2**, you will need to enable **X11 forwarding**.

### Setup Instructions:
1. Follow the instructions in the [MinilibX Linux setup guide](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) to configure X11 forwarding and build the MinilibX library.
2. Once the library and X11 forwarding are set up, you can test the graphics functionality by running the tests in the `minilibx*/test` folder.
3. After confirming that everything is working, you can run the project using the provided Makefile.
